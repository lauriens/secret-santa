# Secret Santa

A small, poorly written (for now) Console Application, that, in a loop, asks for the names and emails of the secret santa participants, then randomly assigns a secret santa for each one, and emails them the results.

For now, both the sender email and the credentials for the SMTP server were hardcoded, thus removed from the commited code.

For the future, if I ever come back to this (see section History for unnecessary details), I intend to:
 * Clean up the code
 * Turn this into a web api
 * Create a friendlier UI
 * Perhaps host the webapp somewhere

# History (aka unnecessary info/rant)

Dec/22: Beta version of the app created, after my mom and my sister kept pestering me to raffle our family's secret santa. After a quick Google search, I found that none of the secret santa apps I tried satisfied me, and decided to create my own, thinking it wouldn't take long, and would be easy (silly me). The objective is to simply require names and emails to assign a secret santa for each person, and nothing else.

TLDR: application created out of spite for pushy family
