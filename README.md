# Secret Santa

A small, poorly written (for now) Web API, that receives a list of names and emails of the secret santa participants, then randomly assigns a secret santa for each one, and emails them the results.

For the future, if I ever come back to this (see section History for unnecessary details), I intend to:
 * Clean up the code
 * Create a friendlier UI
 * Perhaps host the webapp somewhere

# History (aka unnecessary info/rant)

Dec/22: Beta version of the app created, after my mom and my sister kept pestering me to raffle our family's secret santa. After a quick Google search, I found that none of the secret santa apps I tried satisfied me, and decided to create my own, thinking it wouldn't take long, and would be easy (silly me). The objective is to simply require names and emails to assign a secret santa for each person, and nothing else.

TLDR: application created out of spite for pushy family

Dec/23: Finished transforming the app into a web API; after yet another year of stress from the family, from taking a whole ass month to decide if we'd do a secret santa or not, to, once decided, demanding the results ASAP, now the application sends the name of each secret santa as an image, and as an HTML attachment. Code still ugly AF, but honestly, no energy (or time) to refactor it as of now. See you next year!

TLDR: Web API + Image and HTML attachment
